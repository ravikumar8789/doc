# Authentication System Documentation

## Overview
The Authentication System is the foundation of the Skill Swap Platform, providing secure user registration, login, and account management. It integrates with Supabase Auth to handle all authentication operations with proper security measures and user experience considerations.

## Core Features

### 1. User Registration
**Purpose**: Allow new users to create accounts and join the platform

**How it Works**:
- Users provide email, password, and basic profile information
- System validates email format and password strength
- Creates user account in Supabase Auth with email verification requirement
- Automatically creates corresponding profile in the public.users table
- Sends verification email to user's provided email address
- User must verify email before accessing full platform features

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Auth's signUp method
- Implements form validation with proper error handling
- Creates user profile with default values (0 points, empty skills arrays)
- Handles duplicate email scenarios gracefully

### 2. User Login
**Purpose**: Authenticate existing users and establish secure sessions

**How it Works**:
- Users enter email and password credentials
- System validates credentials against Supabase Auth
- On successful authentication, creates user session
- Automatically redirects to main application
- Maintains session state across app restarts
- Handles login failures with appropriate error messages

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Auth's signInWithPassword method
- Implements session persistence with automatic token refresh
- Provides loading states and error feedback
- Integrates with Riverpod state management for user state

### 3. Email Verification
**Purpose**: Ensure email addresses are valid and prevent fake accounts

**How it Works**:
- After registration, users receive verification email
- Email contains secure verification link
- User clicks link to verify email address
- System updates user's email verification status
- Unverified users see warning screen with resend option
- Prevents access to platform features until verified

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Auth's email verification system
- Implements verification status checking
- Provides resend verification email functionality
- Shows appropriate UI states for verified/unverified users

### 4. Password Reset
**Purpose**: Allow users to recover access to their accounts

**How it Works**:
- Users can request password reset from login screen
- System sends reset email with secure reset link
- User clicks link and sets new password
- Old password is invalidated immediately
- User can log in with new password
- Provides clear feedback throughout the process

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Auth's resetPasswordForEmail method
- Implements secure password reset flow
- Handles reset link expiration and validation
- Provides user-friendly error messages

### 5. Account Deletion
**Purpose**: Allow users to permanently remove their accounts and data

**How it Works**:
- Users can request account deletion from profile settings
- System shows confirmation dialog with data deletion warning
- On confirmation, deletes all user-related data from database
- Removes user from Supabase Auth
- Provides final confirmation of deletion
- Handles cleanup of related data (posts, chats, roadmaps)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Auth's deleteUser method
- Implements cascade deletion for user data
- Provides data export option before deletion
- Handles cleanup of related records in all tables

### 6. Session Management
**Purpose**: Maintain secure user sessions and handle authentication state

**How it Works**:
- Automatically manages user login state
- Persists sessions across app restarts
- Handles token refresh automatically
- Logs out users on token expiration
- Provides seamless authentication experience
- Manages authentication state throughout the app

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Auth's session management
- Implements automatic token refresh
- Integrates with Riverpod for state management
- Handles authentication state changes
- Provides loading states during authentication

### 7. Profile Image Upload
**Purpose**: Allow users to personalize their profiles with images

**How it Works**:
- Users can upload profile images from device gallery or camera
- System validates image format and size
- Uploads image to Supabase Storage
- Updates user profile with image URL
- Provides image preview and editing options
- Handles upload progress and error states

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Supabase Storage for image hosting
- Implements image picker with camera/gallery options
- Provides image compression and validation
- Updates user profile with secure image URLs
- Handles upload progress and error feedback
