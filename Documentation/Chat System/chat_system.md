# Chat System Documentation

## Overview
The Chat System enables real-time communication between users on the Skill Swap Platform, facilitating the connection between teachers and learners. It provides a comprehensive messaging solution with session management, message history, and integration with the platform's learning workflow. The system ensures secure, efficient, and user-friendly communication that supports the platform's peer-to-peer learning model.

## Core Features

### 4. Chat Status
**Purpose**: Track and manage chat session states

**How it Works**:
- **Pending**: Initial state when chat is created but not yet accepted
- **Accepted**: Teacher has accepted the learning request
- **Rejected**: Teacher has declined the learning request
- **Completed**: Learning session has been finished
- **Cancelled**: Chat session was cancelled by either party
